# LlamaOS
LlamaOS is an Open Source Operating System which is based on the linux kernal.
### The Idea
We want to create an Operating System that is accessible and very customisable. Anyone is welcome to modify and improve the OS with their ideas. By basing it on the linux kernal we don't have to worry about creating custom programs just for LlamaOS, because all Linux applications will run on LlamaOS too.

### The Team

Our Team only consists of 2 people at the moment. We are both beginners when it comes to coding an Operating System, so do not expect this OS to be perfect from the beginning on.
